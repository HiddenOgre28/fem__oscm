## My process

First, I modified the index.html file and gave the text inside it the structure of a card. Then, I styled the card in CSS by using Sass and looking at the designs provided by Frontend Mentor in the design folder. 

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS3 custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- [Sass](https://sass-lang.com/) - CSS preprocessor

### What I learned

While styling the card and researching for this challenge, I learned about:

- The box-shadow property.
- The importance of utilizing hsl() for colors.
- To work with svg-type images.

### Continued development

I haven't fully grasped how to build a layout using Grid yet, so I would be reading about it and trying it out myself, so I can use Grid in my next challenge.
